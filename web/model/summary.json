/* A survey has summaries. A summary is made up of multiple questionnaires, 
 * which in turn have multiple questions. 
 * 
 * A building is made up of multiple components, which are in some way related.
 *
 * The template is what links them together, through subparts of each question
 * called inquiries. Each inquiry can represent a logical state that depends 
 * on other inquiries or a question itself.
 * 
 * The logical parts are 'or' 'and' 'not' and 'xor'. In addition, the items may
 * be collected according to their relationship 'allOf' or 'anyOf'. Finally, at
 * the top is an 'if' 'then' 'else' to link the imperative parts.
 * 
 * The question itself can take the form of a 'min' 'max' 'minMax' or 'yesNo'
 * question.
 * 
 * When each question is hit from the questionnaires, it inquires each of the
 * questions as it runs across them, so there is no need for duplication.
